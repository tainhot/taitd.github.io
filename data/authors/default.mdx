I'm Tai is a Software Engineer in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. I works in weekdays and I love to developing my side projects in nights and weekends.

In my thought, programming languages or frameworks are tools but require deep learning. Properly, good ux and built architecture are important to making high quality product. Building stable, efficient, and resuable functionality are my priorities.

My strongest skills are Javascript and PHP.

And there are also following good skills I have programmed through like:
- Javacript: NodeJs, Typescript, NestJs, NextJs, ReactJs, Angular 2(v6+), jQuery.
- PHP: Laravel 5+, Yii, Yii2.
- UI/UX and Frontend: HTML5, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind.
